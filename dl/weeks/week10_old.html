				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Peer Reviewed Project Check</p><br>
					<p>Today we make the check about the project status.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Remember from last week</p>
					<p class="slidewithalotoftext">We create Breakout Rooms, and in each Breakout Rooms there are two groups.</p>
					<p class="slidewithalotoftext">The first group has 5 minutes to explain the project, and the other group 2 minutes for feedback and questions. Then group switches and the second group explains and first gives feedback. In total it should
						take 14-15 minutes.</p>
					<p class="slidewithalotoftext">Afterwards we come back to the main session and each group reports shortly what they learned from the others. So listen carefully.</p>

			<!-- QUIZ -->
			<section>
				<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ (15 mins)</p><br>
				<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
					1. How would you define human and optimal performances in your project? Are they the same?
				</p>
				<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
					2. Do you expect your results to be close to one of them?
				</p>
				<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
					3. We divide the project in 3 parts: <br>
					a) data preprocessing,
					b) building a model and getting it to work,
					c) fine tuning to achieve good results.
					Which part do you see as the easiest, and which as the most complex?
				</p>
				<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
					4. Can you use transfer learning on your project? What should the model know?
				</p>
				<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
					5. Can you think of a way to divide your objective in smaller tasks? (or the opposite)
				</p>
				<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
					6. If you had 3 more months on your projects, what would be your next step? Assuming no money/time limitation, would you like to have more/better data, an expert validating your data, a more complex model, a more powerful machine to iterate
					the hyperparameter search, some time to test and apply different regularization techniques or something else?
