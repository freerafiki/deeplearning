				<!-- QUIZ -->
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Open Questions (15 mins)</p><br>
					<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
						1. Which approach would you use in your project? Train one model and try to fine-tune it, or train several models and see which one works better?<br>
						2. About hyperparameters search: which would you use? random, grid search, or a different solution? Is there a specific reason behind? <br>
						3. If we use batch normalization, should we stop using normalization before the input layer? Should we use batch normalization in only some layers or an all levels?<br>
						4. In which sense batch normalization makes the network train faster? If we add computations, shouldn't the single iteration be slower?<br>
						5. Now you have seen many techniques as regularization, momentum, dropout, batch normalization. Would you use all of them in your project? Why?<br>
						6. Let's say you have to classify the animals in one image. You want to know if there are any dogs, cats, ducks or horses in the image, or none of the above.
						So you have 5 classes. How many neurons would you use in your output layer?
						And which activation function? Why?
