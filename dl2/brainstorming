Advanced Deep Learning:

    Let's have a short brainstorming session:

    Write down here below some ideas that you may have for your project. (Each person has a different color, you can set your name on the top right corner (or bottom, depending on screen size), but it's not needed, anonymous is also fine).

 Face Mask Recognition 2.0
 -> Do the Face Mask NN "properly"

  2.   Object Detection/ Localization  in a video ( YOLO like ) ||  Pose Estimation
  Object detection to use

  Text processing using recurrent models

  prediction of some financial process with special data ( like opening price of stock market or sth else)


  image recognition and classification (Building on the painting classification idea especially distinguish between real and fake paintings.)


  Image Classification (like doing some thing with detecting and classifying plants by their images.)



  1. object detection to identify the face (maybe also the ehnecity) then it give option to choose the different ethnic version of the face.

2. create a chess game player
