          <section>
            <p class="slidetitle">Quiz</p><br>
            <p>We will start now with a quiz based on the first week material</p>
            <p>You have 6 minutes to answer the quiz. </p>
            <p>The quiz link: <br>

				<!-- QUESTIONS -->
				<section>
          <section>
            <p class="slidetitle">Project Check</p><br>
            <p>Today we skip the quiz and make a small check about the project, how you started and what your objectives are.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p class="slidetitle">How it works</p><br>
            <p class="fragment slidewithalotoftext">We create Breakout Rooms, and in each Breakout Rooms there are two groups.</p>
            <p class="fragment slidewithalotoftext">The first group has 3 minutes to explain the project, and the other group 2 minutes for feedback and questions. Then group switches and the sceond group explains and first gives feedback. In total it takes 10 minutes.</p>
            <p class="fragment slidewithalotoftext">Afterwards we come back to the main session and each group reports shortly what they learned from the others. So listen carefully.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <p class="slidetitle">What should be explained</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The choice of the dataset</li>
              <li>The choice of the network architecture (if already made)</li>
              <li>The objective (what you want to achieve)</li>
              <li>The problems or challenges you face</li>
            </ul>
          </section>

				<!-- QUIZ -->
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ (15 mins)</p><br>
					<p class="slidewithalotoftext">
            1. Do we really need orthogonalization or we can forget about it? When would it help?<br>
            2. Thinking about your own project, how would you measure human performances? And the optimal (bayes) error? <br>
            Do you expect your results to be close to these performances?<br>
						3. How would you structure a project: let's assume we divide it in 3 main steps: <br>a) data preprocessing, b) building a model and getting it to work, c) fine tuning to achieve good results.<br>
						Which part do you see as the easiest, and which as the most complex? How would you divide your time into these three parts?
