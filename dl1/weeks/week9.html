						<p class="slidetitle">Presentation of the final project</p>
						<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
							<li>Each group will make a presentation. Ideally, the presentation would be divided among all members of the group.</li>
              <li>Each group should take 10-15 minutes. There will be the presentation and a round of questions.</li>
							<li>The structure of the presentation is not strictly fixed, nor it is its content. However, there are some suggestions to have similar structures.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Guidelines for the presentation</p>
						<ul class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
							<li><b>Group</b>: who are the people in the group.</li>
                     <li><b>Project</b>: short description of the project and the motivation behind.</li>
							<li><b>(*Optional) Tools</b>: which tools you used and how you managed to work in a group.</li>
                     <li><b>Architecture</b>: what architecture did you use, how many layers, which function (you can be technical on this part)</li>
							<li><b>(*Optional) Story</b>: attempts, failures, successes, whatever happened in the process. Sometimes what did not work can be as important as what worked!</li>
							<li><b>Results</b>: how it works? can you quantify results or show some visualizations?</li>
							<li><b>Baselines</b>:
								<ul>
									<li>is there a simple baseline with which you can compare? It can be as simple as the mean of the data for time series prediction, or a fixed value of 0.5 for the accuracy in a binary classification problem.</li>
									<li>can you measure human performances on the task? can you personally take some samples from the test set and solve the problem yourself, and quantify the results?</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><b>(*Optional) Missing:</b> is there something you missed to improve the project? Time, material, knowledge, data, computational power?</li>
							<li><b>(*Optional) Future works:</b> how could the project be improved or extended?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Sharing is caring</p>
						If not otherwise discussed with a single group,
						we will add your project to our <a href="https://opencampus-sh.github.io/ML-Projects/">Project Page</a>
						<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
							<li><b>Code</b>: Provide a link to your repository if you have one,
								and also some short instructions to reproduce it if needed<br>
                Please check that the code is at clean (no testing or commented code)
								and has comments or text fields to understand it!</li>
							<li><b>Data:</b> mention if the data is public (with link),
								or if it is not possible to share.</li>
						</ul>

				<!-- QUESTIONS -->
				<section>
          <section>
            <p class="slidetitle">Peer Reviewed Project Check</p><br>
            <p>Today we make the check about the project status.</p>
          </section>
          <section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Remember from last week</p>
						<p class="slidewithalotoftext">We create Breakout Rooms, and in each Breakout Rooms there are two groups.</p>
            <p class="slidewithalotoftext">The first group has 5 minutes to explain the project, and the other group 2 minutes for feedback and questions. Then group switches and the second group explains and first gives feedback. In total it should take 14-15 minutes.</p>
            <p class="slidewithalotoftext">Afterwards we come back to the main session and each group reports shortly what they learned from the others. So listen carefully.</p>

				<!-- QUIZ -->
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ (15 mins)</p><br>
					<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
            1. How would you define human and optimal performances in your project? Are they the same?
					</p>
					<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
            2. Do you expect your results to be close to one of them?
					</p>
					<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
						3. We divide the project in 3 parts: <br>
						a) data preprocessing,
						b) building a model and getting it to work,
						c) fine tuning to achieve good results.
						Which part do you see as the easiest, and which as the most complex?
					</p>
					<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
						4. Can you use transfer learning on your project? What should the model know?
					</p>
					<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
						5. Can you think of a way to divide your objective in smaller tasks? (or the opposite)
					</p>
					<p class="slidewithreallyalotoftext pb-1">
						6. If you had 3 more months on your projects, what would be your next step? Assuming no money/time limitation, would you like to have more/better data, an expert validating your data, a more complex model, a more powerful machine to iterate the hyperparameter search, some time to test and apply different regularization techniques or something else?
