						<p class="slidetitle">Presentation of the final project</p>
						<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
							<li>Each group will make a presentation. Ideally, the presentation would be divided among all members of the group.</li>
              <li>Each group should take 10-15 minutes. There will be the presentation and a round of questions.</li>
							<li>The structure of the presentation is not strictly fixed, nor it is its content. However, there are some suggestions to have similar structures.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Guidelines for the presentation</p>
						<ul class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
							<li><b>Group</b>: who are the people in the group.</li>
                     <li><b>Project</b>: short description of the project and the motivation behind.</li>
							<li><b>(*Optional) Tools</b>: which tools you used and how you managed to work in a group.</li>
                     <li><b>Architecture</b>: what architecture did you use, how many layers, which function (you can be technical on this part)</li>
							<li><b>(*Optional) Story</b>: attempts, failures, successes, whatever happened in the process. Sometimes what did not work can be as important as what worked!</li>
							<li><b>Results</b>: how it works? can you quantify results or show some visualizations?</li>
							<li><b>Baselines</b>:
								<ul>
									<li>is there a simple baseline with which you can compare? It can be as simple as the mean of the data for time series prediction, or a fixed value of 0.5 for the accuracy in a binary classification problem.</li>
									<li>can you measure human performances on the task? can you personally take some samples from the test set and solve the problem yourself, and quantify the results?</li>
								</ul>
							</li>
							<li><b>(*Optional) Missing:</b> is there something you missed to improve the project? Time, material, knowledge, data, computational power?</li>
							<li><b>(*Optional) Future works:</b> how could the project be improved or extended?</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">Sharing is caring</p>
						Would you like to share and make the project available for everyone?
						<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
							<li><b>Code</b>: is the code online, are you willing to share, can you provide a link to a repository that ideally contains some short instructions to reproduce it?<br>
                       Please check that the code is at least clean (no testing or commented code) and hopefully some short comments/text to understand it!</li>
							<li><b>Data:</b> is the data public, or it is not possible to share?</li>
							<li><b>Presentation: </b>Do you allow me to upload/link the presentation (here I mean the slides) to the website for the next semesters?</li>
						</ul>

				<!-- QUESTIONS -->
				<section>
          <section>
            <p class="slidetitle">Project Check</p><br>
            <p>Today we skip the quiz and make a small check about the project, how you started and what your objectives are.</p>

				<!-- QUIZ -->
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">QUIZ (15 mins)</p><br>
					<p class="slidewithalotoftext">
            1. Do we really need orthogonalization or we can forget about it? When would it help?<br>
            2. Thinking about your own project, how would you measure human performances? And the optimal (bayes) error? <br>
            Do you expect your results to be close to these performances?<br>
						3. How would you structure a project: let's assume we divide it in 3 main steps: <br>a) data preprocessing, b) building a model and getting it to work, c) fine tuning to achieve good results.<br>
						Which part do you see as the easiest, and which as the most complex? How would you divide your time into these three parts?<br>
						4. Can you use transfer learning on your project? To have better results, what would you like the network to have learned before you fine-tune it?<br>
						5. Can you think of a way to use end-to-end deep learning on your project? Or rather divide it into smaller steps? Or none of them fits?<br>
						6. If you had 3 more months on your projects, what would be your next step? Assuming no money/time limitation, would you like to have more/better data, an expert validating your data, a more complex model, a more powerful machine to iterate the hyperparameter search, some time to test and apply different regularization techniques or something else?<br>
