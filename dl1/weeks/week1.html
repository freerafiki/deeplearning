						<p class="slidetitle">Zoom Sessions</p>
						<div class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
							Every Monday at 16.00<br>
							<p class="fragment">1 - Quiz: we start with an ungraded quiz about the last week </p>
							<p class="fragment">2 - Discussion: we discuss shortly about the questions and clarify if anyone has doubts</p>
							<p class="fragment">3 - Open Questions: we prepare some open questions, which you will discuss <b>in small groups</b> (~5 minutes) and then one person per group will present the results</p>
							<p class="fragment">4 - Exercises: some participants will be selected, we go through the assignment together and comment the code (the solutions will be provided from us if you do not want to share yours) </p>
                      <p class="fragment">Remember: there are no grades, we are in a safe space open to discussions, most of the time there is no <i>right or wrong</i> answer. </p>
						</div>

					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">How we discuss <b>in small groups</b>?</p>
						Zoom has the possibility to create breakout rooms.<br>
						This means every person will be automatically assigned to a smaller room where you can freely discuss. <br>
						I will try to go around the rooms to help, but I also believe it's nice to encourage discussion between yourself without supervision<br>
						At the end of the time, you will automatically return back to the group call and we will discuss together about it.

					<p class="slidetitle">For the next week</p>
					<ul>
                  <li>Register to the <a href="https://chat.opencampus.sh/signup_user_complete/?id=c7hdwyxix7rgpr843au1ptqaor">the Mattermost Chat (general link to register)</a>,</li>
                  <li>Write a small presentation <a href="https://chat.opencampus.sh/sose21/channels/c_deep-learning-from-scratch">in the Course channel (specific link channel)</a>, if you did not yet,</li>
						<li>Register on Coursera and start the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">Neural Networks and Deep Learning</a> course,</li>
						<li>Finish the first week of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">course</a></li>
					</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p class="slidetitle">(OPTIONAL)</p>
						 If you have enough time, start looking at the second week of the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning">course</a>. The two weeks are not equally divided, estimated times are ~2 hours for the first week and ~8 hours for the second. Therefore, it may be better to divide in two blocks of 5 hours per week. <br>
						The second week is divided into <b>Logistic Regression</b> and <b>Python Vectorization</b>. Maybe one of the two part could be started already this week, to make it lighter for the next week.
