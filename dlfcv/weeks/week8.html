				<p class="slidetitle-2">QUIZ</p><br>
				<p>We will start now with a quiz based on the last week material</p>
				<p>You have 6 minutes to answer the quiz. </p>
				<p>The quiz link: <br>
					<a href="https://forms.office.com/r/ZdGqCj1KDB" target="_blank">Quiz Link</a><br>
					It will be copied in Mattermost and in the Zoom chat.

				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle-2">Remaining Sessions</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>after holiday (10.12):</b> Neural Style Transfer</li>
						<li><b>last sessions (17.01):</b> Final presentations</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Presentation of the final project</p>
					<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
						<li>Each group will make a presentation. Ideally, the presentation would be divided among all members of the group.</li>
						<li>Each group should take 15 minutes. There will be the presentation and a round of questions.</li>
						<li>The structure of the presentation is not strictly fixed, nor it is its content. However, there are some suggestions to have similar structures.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Guidelines for the presentation</p>
					<ul class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
						<li><b>Group</b>: who are the people in the group.</li>
						<li><b>Project</b>: short description of the project and the motivation behind.</li>
						<li><b>(*Optional) Tools</b>: which tools you used and how you managed to work in a group.</li>
						<li><b>Architecture</b>: what architecture did you use, how many layers, which function (you can be technical on this part)</li>
						<li><b>(*Optional) Story</b>: attempts, failures, successes, whatever happened in the process. Sometimes what did not work can be as important as what worked!</li>
						<li><b>Results</b>: how it works? can you quantify results or show some visualizations?</li>
						<li><b>Baselines</b>:
							<ul>
								<li>is there a simple baseline with which you can compare? It can be as simple as the mean of the data for time series prediction, or a fixed value of 0.5 for the accuracy in a binary classification problem.</li>
								<li>can you measure human performances on the task? can you personally take some samples from the test set and solve the problem yourself, and quantify the results?</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li><b>(*Optional) Missing:</b> is there something you missed to improve the project? Time, material, knowledge, data, computational power?</li>
						<li><b>(*Optional) Future works:</b> how could the project be improved or extended?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Sharing is caring</p>
					If not otherwise discussed with a single group,
					we will add your project to our <a href="https://opencampus-sh.github.io/ML-Projects/">Project Page</a>
					<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
						<li><b>Code</b>: Provide a link to your repository if you have one,
							and also some short instructions to reproduce it if needed<br>
							Please check that the code is clean (no testing or commented code)
							and has comments or text fields to understand it!</li>
						<li><b>Data:</b> mention if the data is public (with link),
							or if it is not possible to share.</li>
					</ul>

				<p class="slidetitle-2">Open Questions (10 Minutes)</p><br>
				<ol class="slidewithalotoftext">
					<li>How does one-shot learning work? Can we apply this to other problems than face recognition? Can you make an example?</li>
					<li>How do we choose triplets which are "hard" for the network? Can we do this before having learned the similarity function?</li>
					<li>How would you compute the liveness of an image, preventing people to cheat with a photo?</li>
				</ol>
