			<!-- QUIZ -->
			<section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Quiz</p><br>
					<p>We will start now with a quiz based on the first week material</p>
					<p>You have 6 minutes to answer the quiz. </p>
					<p>The quiz link: <br>
						<a href="https://forms.office.com/r/SZ05zQSg9C" target="_blank">quiz Link</a><br>
						It will be copied in Mattermost and in the Zoom chat.

			<section>
				<p class="slidetitle">Open Questions (10 minutes)</p>
				<ol class="slidewithalotoftext">
					<li>Are momentum, RMSProp and Adam alternatives to the L2 Regularizaion or Dropout we have seen last week?</li>
					<li>About exponentially weighted average: can you think of an application in which you want to use larger beta and one where you want to use small value for beta?</li>
					<li>What would happen if we increase (instead of decreasing as in learning rate decay) the learning rate during training?</li>
					<li>Can you describe what a saddle point, a plateau, a local minimum and a global minimum are?
						Do these concepts refers to the weights of the network, to the cost function, to the backpropagation, to the activation functions, or to all of them?</li>
				</ol>

			<!-- EXERCISES -->

				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Exercise (15-20 mins)</p>
					We go through the programming assignment that were planned for this week.<br>
					Here M. Peixeiro actually wrote an article <a href="https://towardsdatascience.com/the-3-best-optimization-methods-in-neural-networks-40879c887873">that explains exactly the solution of the assignment for this week.</a>
