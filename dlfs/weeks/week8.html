			<section>
				<p class="slidetitle">Quiz</p><br>
				<p>We will start now with a survey on your opinion on the course</p>
				<p>The quiz link: <br>

				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Remaining Sessions</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>after holiday (10.12):</b> discussion about architectures</li>
						<li><b>last sessions (17-24.01):</b> final presentations</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Presentation of the final project</p>
					<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
						<li>Each group will make a presentation. Ideally, the presentation would be divided among all members of the group.</li>
						<li>Each group should take 10-15 minutes. There will be the presentation and a round of questions.</li>
						<li>The structure of the presentation is not strictly fixed, nor it is its content. However, there are some suggestions to have similar structures.</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Guidelines for the presentation</p>
					<ul class="slidewithreallyalotoftext">
						<li><b>Group</b>: who are the people in the group.</li>
						<li><b>Project</b>: short description of the project and the motivation behind.</li>
						<li><b>(*Optional) Tools</b>: which tools you used and how you managed to work in a group.</li>
						<li><b>Architecture</b>: what architecture did you use, how many layers, which function (you can be technical on this part)</li>
						<li><b>(*Optional) Story</b>: attempts, failures, successes, whatever happened in the process. Sometimes what did not work can be as important as what worked!</li>
						<li><b>Results</b>: how it works? can you quantify results or show some visualizations?</li>
						<li><b>Baselines</b>: compare with human performances?</li>
						<li><b>(*Optional) Missing:</b> is there something you missed to improve the project? Time, material, knowledge, data, computational power?</li>
						<li><b>(*Optional) Future works:</b> how could the project be improved or extended?</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Sharing is caring</p>
					If not otherwise discussed with a single group,
					we will add your project to our <a href="https://opencampus-sh.github.io/ML-Projects/">Project Page</a>
					<ul class="slidewithalotoftext">
						<li><b>Code</b>: Provide a link to your repository if you have one,
							and also some short instructions to reproduce it if needed<br>
							Please check that the code is clean (no testing or commented code)
							and has comments or text fields to understand it!</li>
						<li><b>Data:</b> mention if the data is public (with link),
							or if it is not possible to share.</li>
					</ul>

			<!-- Questions -->
			<section>
				<p class="slidetitle">Open Questions (15 mins)</p><br>
				<ol class="slidewithalotoftext">
					<li>Can you come out with one task where machines has not yet human level performances, but most likely in the future will?</li>
					<li>What is the difference between random errors and sistematic errors on the labelling of your training data?</li>
					<li>Can you explain the difference between multi-task and end-to-end learning? Can you make an example for both of them?</li>
				</ol>

				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">How it works</p><br>
					<p class="fragment slidewithalotoftext">We create Breakout Rooms, and in each Breakout Rooms there are two groups.</p>
					<p class="fragment slidewithalotoftext">One group explains (5mins), one group listen. Then switch and repeat.</p>
					<p class="fragment slidewithalotoftext">Afterwards we come back to the main session and each group reports shortly what they learned from the others. So listen carefully.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">What could be explained</p>
					<ul>
						<li>The choice of the dataset and if you are satisfied</li>
						<li>The choice of the network architecture or the doubts</li>
						<li>The objective (what you want to achieve)</li>
						<li>The problems or challenges you are facing</li>
						<li>Whatever else you think may be important</li>
