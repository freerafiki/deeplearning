				<section>
					<p class="slidetitle">Cost function for unsupervised learning</p>
					<p>much wider topic: as an idea, the function it is used for is usually different</p>
					<p>a typical example is to "learn" the characteristics of the input, for example dividing into different clusters or learning a lower dimensional representation. In this case the cost function can be defined as the difference betweeen the
						"learned" representation and the input and is then minimized through the training.</p>

				<p class="slidetitle">Paper of the week</p>
				<a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf"><i>ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks</i></a><br>
				A. Krizhevsky, I. Sutskever, G. E. Hinton <br><i> Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (Lake Tahoe, NV, Dec. 2012), 1097â€“1105.</i>

			<!-- QUIZ -->
			<section>
				<p class="slidetitle">Quiz (15 mins)</p>
				<ul class='slidewithalotoftext'>
					<li>What are the characteristics of an activation function?</li>
					<li>Why we need to have random initialization and we cannot leave all weights equal to zeros?</li>
					<li>We initialize the weights of the neurons randomly. Is this really the best we can do? Do you have an idea about how we could do it?</li>
					<li>Are all neurons of a layer always connected to all the neurons of the next one?</li>
					<li>What is the relation between the cost function, gradient descent, the activation function and the weights of the network?</li>

					We go through the programming assignment that were planned for this week.<br>

				</section>
				<section>
					Q: Is having more hidden units better in terms of performances? Is it worse? Does it depends on a specific parameter? Do you have an intuition why?<br>
					Q2: Does having more hidden layers require more iterations to train?
